summary: "This course enables developers to write non-blocking and asynchronous code using Scala. The course will teach you how to use Scala Futures for writing async code. Along with that, it also covers how actor model can be leveraged to write an asynchronous, message based scalable system."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
abstract: "A good software system should be performant, scalable and efficient. Along with infrastructure, it depends a lot on the way it’s written. In the course, Scala Asynchronous Programming, you’ll learn how to achieve better performance and scalability by non-blocking and asynchronous code.. First, you’ll learn why blocking is not the way to go, you’ll understand why it’s important to write asynchronous code. Then you’ll learn one of the high level abstractions for writing async code i.e. Scala Futures. You’ll learn to create scala Futures and how to handle successful and failed future values. 

Finally, you’ll learn about the actor model and how it can be used to write async message based systems. You’ll learn the basics of using Akka’s actor model, along with writing message protocols, async communication, supervision strategy. You’ll learn how a shared mutable state is handled in Actors. You’ll also get a basic understanding about  routing, mailbox and dispatcher.

By the end of this course, you’ll have the knowledge to use Scala Futures or Actor Model for writing scalable and performant software systems.
