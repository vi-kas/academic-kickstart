summary: "Learn how to use Scala’s functional design patterns, such as Typeclass, Cake, and Lens in order to write a functional, abstract, and structured Scala application or library."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
abstract: "Writing real world applications using Scala requires the ability to write well-structured and easy to understand code. Often this can be achieved using a well-defined design pattern. In the course, Scala Specific Design Patterns, you'll learn to use such design patterns in order to create your own well-structured Scala applications. First, you'll explore how to use Typeclass pattern and Cake pattern. Next, you'll discover how to lazily evaluate expressions. Finally, you’ll dive into the concepts of Lens, Implicits Injection, and Memoization patterns. When you’re finished with the course, you’ll have the necessary knowledge of design patterns needed to understand how, when, and why to use them."
