Are you kidding me? No, but a note at the beginning, there’s going to be a lot of questions in this post. Let’s see if you enjoy it. What do you think? Do we need a definition of what a question is? Nah! We don’t need to have a number of certain words, if put together in a structured manner, making some meaning we already know, do we? Anyway, let me tell you there are two categories of questions.

1.  One that make sense

Okay, stop and guess which one is the second? Yeah, those which do not fall in the first category.

2.  Second, which are not in first category.

And mark my words, I did not say, few questions do not make any sense. Don’t assume it. Don’t believe me? Wait! Take a look at this question:

A. Rank the candidates in order of how bad they were in the interview. Worst takes precedence.

    ___ David

    ___ Cristiano

    ___ Leonardo

    ___ Serena

    ___ Chuck Norris

Did you like the question? Is this a category one or a category two question? Well, I’ll leave that to you, comments are welcome. But, one thing for sure, the one who asked this question, seemed to me as going through something in life and this is not saying that candidates were not good. Or May be it’s a test for the interviewer, god knows. Let’s take a look at another question:

B. Did you watch the movie, Dunkirk?

\_\_\_ Yes

\_\_\_ No

Now, which category does this question falls into? May be the first one, if you’ve something with which you can follow up, then it makes sense to ask questions such as these, or else you know, if you don’t care about the answer, then it’s a sign that boss you’ve got problems! or you’re an introvert. Okay, my turn, one of my favorite questions.

C. What is the meaning of life?

      ___ (Do we need this?)

These are called rhetorical questions. Okay, so did we just give a third classification? No, obviously not, this question does not make any sense, where’s the bucket for category two questions? Few more of these?

D. Why me? (Asked under some serious circumstances)

E. (Girl to her Boy) How much you love me? (ha ha ha)

This one definitely gives the boy some hard time. Well, questions are not always asked to make sense. A lot of times these are asked as answers to themselves. Of course, “Why me?” is of that sort. But why do we bother about them.

Regardless of making sense, questions are there. If you have some, then ask. By the way, why did we choose this picture(Look atop) for our post?

There's no point asking that, is there?
