A morning run gives a perfect start to your day. It keeps you healthy and active. People are enjoying the freshness it provides. But a majority of population are not able to get out of their beds to make it a habit.

I woke up early on Monday, went out, on track, ran, it felt like just now I started living. But I wasn't able to continue next day.
It happens, to a lot of them who give it a try. Getting out of bed, to run is easy to say but very hard when you have to. A morning run is a habit. But if you see it involves few more small but important habits. Your motive is single and simple, to feel active, that's why you choose to run, isn't it? But a run is not. It has a pattern.

What is that?

To run you have to make a habit of waking up early, If you are able to do it a couple of days, it won't take too long and you'll find yourself on track. It's simple first start waking up early, don't push yourself too much, just wake up (Second habit is to get out of bed, if you think getting out of bed a bit different than waking up). Now you are on track, start walking for a couple of days. Let yourself feel easy, you seem to enjoy it, freshness. Believe me you'll find yourself walking with ease in no time. And not too long from that day, you'll start running. You can count running as your habit now, because it's fulfilling your motive. You feel fresh, their was a day when you tried but failed, because it's a habit, it takes time. So tried this pattern. A simpler but effective.

Why this worked?

This ain't magic, what you did is nothing but what you wanted. The key is to understand what's stopping us from our goal. May be there are more than one reasons. Break them, check them one by one. Soon you'll see your problem as a small one. One great thing about it is, when you try simplifying this, chances are more of you being into it, I mean succeeding. Like each time you took one step, chances were more of your doing the next. Yeah, you got it.

Does it work in every aspect of life?

You want to work harder/smarter, get things done and smile, isn't it? Breaking and checking works in every aspect of life, ask yourself. Making a habit, breaking a habit(It's a bad one!), Getting out of depression(might be a relationship or work pressure) for almost everything you can apply. I personally believe it's a pattern, an effective one. So how you apply means a lot. Of course, habit of waking up is prior than, a walk. Simple get the idea, use your assets (Mind, I meant) and do it. I Hope, it'll work out for you. Because a morning run gave us this lesson!
