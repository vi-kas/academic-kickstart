Take bold bets, that’s what they say!
When you try new things, take bold decisions, those are experiments. The thing about an experiment is that you don't know ahead of time if they are gonna work. They are prone to failures. So you try! Try once, try again and again, but end up in failure.

But the good thing about trying is that you might even end up with a Big Success! Or few big successes. That success compensates for dozens and dozens of Things that didn’t work for you.

You need to embrace failure and fail forward!

Failures might drain you, make you feel dull and sad. But you need to find your harmony. For most people, it’s about meaning. People want to know that they are doing something interesting and useful.

You need to be proud, not of your gifts, but your hard work and choices. You can be grateful for the gifts given to you. But it takes hard work to transform those gifts into success through hard work.
